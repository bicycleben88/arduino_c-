# Notes from Motion Detector

![arduino board with ultrasonic distance sensor](/assets/images/ultrasonic_distance_sensor.png)

<p>The TRIG pin sends out an ultrasonic signal, which bounces off an object and returns to the sensor. The ECHO pin detects the ultrasonic signal that bounced off an object. The VCC pin is the power source and plugs into the 5V pin. The GND pin is the ground and plugs into a GND pin on the Arduino board</p>
